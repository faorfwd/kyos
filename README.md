Claude is powerful — but without structure, conversations drift, context gets lost, and results are inconsistent. `kyos-cli` gives you a proven workflow so you don't have to figure that out yourself. One command sets it up in your project; from there, Claude knows how to guide you from idea to working code.

## Quickstart

```bash
npx kyos-cli --init
```

- Sets up everything Claude Code needs in your project — commands, workflow steps, and a base config.
- Safe to run on an existing project: it shows you what it would change before doing anything.
- Run `--apply` to add only what's missing, or `--init --force` to start fresh.

## The workflow

Getting great results from Claude on complex tasks takes more than a single prompt — you need structure, clear steps, and a way to keep context across the session. `kyos-cli` gives you all of that out of the box.

`kyos-cli` installs a structured workflow that breaks the process into clear steps:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/kyos:spec` | Nail down what you're building before touching any code |
| `/kyos:tech` | Turn the idea into a concrete plan Claude can follow |
| `/kyos:tasks` | Break the plan into small, checkable steps |
| `/kyos:implement` | Execute the steps one by one, with verification at each |
| `/kyos:verify` | Confirm the result actually matches what was planned |

Run them in order for any feature or fix:

```text
/kyos:spec → /kyos:tech → /kyos:tasks → /kyos:implement → /kyos:verify
```

Each step saves its output to a file, so you can pause, resume in a new session, or hand off to someone else without losing context.

There are also two planning commands for bigger decisions:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/kyos:prevalidate` | Quick safety check before making changes |
| `/kyos:architecture` | Set or revise your project's technical direction |
| `/kyos:hire` | Add support for tools or patterns missing from your stack |

## Tips

- **Compact after spec or tech** — if the context meter hits 50%+ after `/kyos:spec` or `/kyos:tech`, run `/compact` before continuing. Everything is saved to disk, so nothing is lost and the next command starts with a clean budget.
- **Clear before implement** — run `/clear` just before `/kyos:implement` to give the implementation run the full context window. Then reference the saved tasks file directly: `/kyos:implement @docs/execution/your-feature/tasks.md`.
- **Pick up where you left off** — if `spec.md`, `tech.md`, or `tasks.md` already exist when you open a new session, pass them in directly: `/kyos:tech @docs/execution/your-feature/spec.md`. Claude will read the file and continue from there.
- **Keep earlier files in sync** — if something changes during `/kyos:tech` or `/kyos:tasks` (scope shifts, new constraints, a better approach), reflect those changes back in the earlier files too. Keeping spec, tech, and tasks aligned means they can later be assembled into accurate feature documentation with minimal effort.

## CLI commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `kyos-cli --init` | Set up or inspect an existing setup (default) |
| `kyos-cli --init --force` | Reset everything to a clean baseline |
| `kyos-cli --apply` | Add only missing files, never overwrites anything |
| `kyos-cli --update` | Pull in the latest managed files without touching your customizations |
| `kyos-cli --add <type> <name>` | Add a skill, agent, or MCP from the catalog |
| `kyos-cli --doctor` | Check that everything is in order |

## Catalog

Extend your setup with optional capabilities:

```bash
kyos-cli --add skill release-notes
kyos-cli --add skill security-audit
kyos-cli --add skill path-safety
kyos-cli --add skill mcp-hardening
kyos-cli --add skill secrets-and-supply-chain

kyos-cli --add agent triage

kyos-cli --add mcp context7
kyos-cli --add mcp filesystem
```

Each addition creates a file you can fill with project-specific guidance. MCP entries are wired up automatically.

## Multi-repo rollout

The CLI runs in whatever directory you're in, so you can roll it out across projects with a simple loop:

```bash
for repo in ./repo-a ./repo-b ./repo-c; do
  (cd "$repo" && npx kyos-cli --init)
done
```

## Security

- **Zero runtime dependencies** — no third-party code runs when you install or use `kyos-cli`.
- **No install scripts** — nothing executes automatically at install time.
- **Publish provenance** — every release is cryptographically verifiable via [npm provenance attestation](https://docs.npmjs.com/generating-provenance-statements).
- **Lockfile committed** — dependency versions are pinned and regenerated on every release.
- **Path safety** — all file operations are strictly sandboxed to your project directory.
